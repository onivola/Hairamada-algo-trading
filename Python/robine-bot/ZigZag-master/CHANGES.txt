v0.1.0, 2014-02-21 -- Initial Release, refactored version of my poorly
                      executed TSGeom package.
v0.1.1, 2014-02-25 -- Change README.txt to README.rst so that Github will 
                      process it correctly.
v0.1.2, 2014-03-20 -- FIX bug that caused install error due to changed README
                      file name. 
v0.1.3, 2014-03-20 -- FIX of previous FIX. Apparently, I don't understand the 
                      README.rst usage pattern.
